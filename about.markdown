Hi. 

My name is Parker. 

I'm good at math (or so I'm told). The truth is I just like to learn and the best way to learn is to teach. I have notable experience in working with others, young and old, and coaching them in the ways of mathematics and other odd subjects they may request. 

Nowadays I spend my time continuing my career testing software for the U.S. Army. 

### Qualifications
- Bachelors of Science: Engineering (BSE)
- Mathematics Minor
- 100+ accredited university-level tutoring hours
- Verified AI Mathematics Consultant 

### Fun Facts
- In college, I was a certified mathematics tutor and a student ambassador for [Wolfram LLC](https://www.wolfram.com/), a computational engine behind Apple's personal assistant: Siri. 
- My favorite class in college was Optimization.
- One day, I want to go on to teach math full time.
